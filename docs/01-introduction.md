# High-performance computing

<div class="column">

- High performance computing is fueled by ever increasing performance
- Increasing performance allows breakthroughs in many major challenges that
  humankind faces today

</div>

# HPC through the ages

<div class="column" width="55%">
- Achieving performance has been based on various strategies throughout the years
    - Frequency, vectorization, multi-node, multi-core, etc.
- Accelerators provide compute resources based on a very high level of parallelism to reach high performance at low relative power consumption

# Accelerators

- Specialized parallel hardware for compute-intensive operations
    - Co-processors for traditional CPUs
    - Based on highly parallel architectures
    - Graphics processing units (GPU) have been the most common
      accelerators during the last few years
- Promises
    - Very high performance per node
- Usually major rewrites of programs required



# Accelerator model today


- Local memory in GPU
    - Smaller than main memory (32 GB in Puhti, 128 GB in LUMI)
    - Very high bandwidth (up to 3200 GB/s in LUMI)
    - Latency high compared to compute performance

![](img/gpu-bws.png){width=100%}

- GPUs are connected to CPUs via PCIe
- Data must be copied from CPU to GPU over the PCIe bus

# GPU architecture

<div class="column" width=56%>
- Designed for running thousands or tens of thousands of threads simultaneously
- Running large amounts of threads hides memory access penalties
    - The relative benefit of using a GPU often increases with an increasing job size
- Recurring data movement between CPU and GPU is often a bottleneck
- The penalty for context switching is relatively small

# Challenges in using Accelerators

**Applicability**: Is your algorithm suitable for GPU?

**Programmability**: Is the programming effort acceptable?

**Portability**: Rapidly evolving ecosystem and incompatibilities between vendors.

**Availability**: Can you access a (large scale) system with GPUs?

**Scalability**: Can you scale the GPU software efficiently to several nodes?


#  Heterogeneous Programming Model

- GPUs are co-processors to the CPU
- CPU controls the work flow:
  - *offloads* computations to GPU by launching *kernels*
  - allocates and deallocates the memory on GPUs
  - handles the data transfers between CPU and GPUs
- CPU and GPU can work concurrently
   - kernel launches are normally asynchronous

# Using GPUs

<div class="column">
1. Use existing GPU applications
2. Use accelerated libraries
3. Directive based methods
    - OpenMP, OpenACC
4. Use native GPU language
    - CUDA, **HIP**, SYCL, Kokkos,...
</div>
<div class="column" width=40%>
Easier, but more limited

More difficult, but more opportunities

</div>




# Directive-based accelerator languages

- Annotating code to pinpoint accelerator-offloadable regions
- OpenACC
    - created in 2011, latest version is 3.1 (November 2020)
    - Mostly Nvidia
- OpenMP
    - Earlier only threading for CPUs
    - initial support for accelerators in 4.0 (2013), significant improvements & extensions in 4.5 (2015), 5.0 (2018), 5.1 (2020 and 5.2 (2021)

- Focus on optimizing productivity
- Reasonable performance with quite limited effort, but not guaranteed



# Native GPU code: HIP / CUDA

- CUDA
    - has been the *de facto* standard for native GPU code for years
    - extensive set of optimised libraries available
    - custom syntax (extension of C++) supported only by CUDA compilers
    - support only for NVIDIA devices
- HIP
    - AMD effort to offer a common programming interface that works on
      both CUDA and ROCm devices
    - standard C++ syntax, uses nvcc/hcc compiler in the background
    - almost a one-on-one clone of CUDA from the user perspective
    - ecosystem is new and developing fast


# GPUs @ CSC

- **Puhti-AI**: 80 nodes, total peak performance of 2.7 Petaflops
    - Four Nvidia V100 GPUs, two 20-core Intel Xeon processors, 3.2 TB fast local storage, network connectivity of 200Gbps aggregate bandwidth  
- **Mahti-AI**: 24 nodes, total peak performance of 2. Petaflops
    - Four Nvidia A100 GPUs, two 64-core AMD Epyc processors, 3.8 TB fast local storage,  network connectivity of 200Gbps aggregate bandwidth   
- **LUMI-G**: 2560 nodes, total peak performance of 500 Petaflops
    - Four AMD MI250X GPUs, one 64-core AMD Epyc processor, 2x3 TB fast local storage, network connectivity of 800Gbps aggregate bandwidth
