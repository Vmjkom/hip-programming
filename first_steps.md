## Accessing LUMI

Are you able to `ssh` to LUMI? If not, have you followed the instructions [here](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/)?

If you haven't added the ssh-key correctly or cannot otherwise `ssh` to LUMI, you can use the [web interface](https://www.lumi.csc.fi/public/).
See the [documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/loggingin-webui/) for more help.

## Getting the course material

You can clone this git repository with `git clone https://github.com/csc-training/hip-programming.git`.
This way you get a local access to the lectures, as well as the exercises (which you need to run on LUMI).

## Using slurm

Supercomputers like LUMI are shared resources, meaning multiple users are using them at the same time.
To run something on LUMI, you need to use SLURM to submit a job.

Read the [LUMI documentation](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/) on running jobs to find out more.
