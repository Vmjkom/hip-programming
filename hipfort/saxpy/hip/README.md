# SAXPY with using HIPFORT 
Apply the above procedure to the `saxpy`  code in the present folder  and inspect the codes in the `rocm` repository folder `hipfort` containing the example (test) codes `.../hipfort/test/f2003`. 
See how the memory management (allocations and transfers) are done and how  various `hipxxx` libraries are called in `Fortran` programs. 
If you have previous experience with CUDA Fortran you can it to the equivalent code in the [cuda](../cuda) folder.
